  <h1>Machine learning ethics</h1>
  <div class="date">Tue Dec 19 2017</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Today I found and watched one of the most important videos on machine learning published this year</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re building a dystopia just to make people click on ads
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI&amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI&amp;app=desktop</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go watch it first before reading ahead! I could not possibly summarise it without doing it a
disservice.</p>
<p>What struck me most was the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having interviewed people who worked at Facebook, I&#39;m convinced that nobody there really
understands how it [the machine learning system] works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important question is, howcome nobody understands how a machine learning system works? You
would think, its because the system is very complex, its hard for any one person to understand it
fully. Thats not the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is fundamental to machine learning systems.</p>
<p>A machine learning system is a program that is given a target goal, a list of actions,
a history of results and the personal information of the user.</p>
<p>The goal could be e.g. to maximise the time the user stays on a video sharing website. More
generally, a value function is given by the users that measures the desireability of a certain
outcome or behaviour (it could include multiple things like number of product bought, mnumber of
ads clicked or viewed, etc)</p>
<p>The list of possible actions, could be a list of videos it can show in the sidebar on the right.</p>
<p>The result is the input to the value function. How long did a certain user stay on the website
after they were shown certain content on the website? How many ads did they click? How many
products did they buy?</p>
<p>The personal history of a user could be, for example, which videos they&#39;ve watched in the past
few months, their gender, age and so on (many companies have a lot more).</p>
<p>Based on these results, the system learns how to tailor its actions (the videos it shows) so that
it causes that particular person in that particular situation to stay longer on the website.</p>
<p>At the beginning it will try random things. After several iterations, it will find things that
&quot;stick&quot; i.e. maximise the value. There are sophisticated techniques to get unstuck from local
maximums too, in order to find even bigger maximums.</p>
<p>Once trained and ran to determine actions in a certain situation, it will do some calculations and
conclude: &quot;well, when I encountered a situation like this other times, I tried these 5 options, and
one of those maximised that value I&#39;m told to maximise in most of the cases, so I&#39;ll do that&quot;.</p>
<p>Sure, there are ways to ask some ML systems why they made a decision after the fact, and they can
elaborate the variables that had the most effect. But before the algorithm gets the training data,
you <em>don&#39;t</em> know what it will decide - nobody does!</p>
<p>Remember there are thousands of people visiting this site every day, so the algorithm can try a
lot of stuff in a very short time. After a while it will start noticing certain patterns. For
example, it seems that people who generally watch cat videos will stay a lot longer if they are
given cat videos in their suggestion box.  Moreover, that will happen even if situations when they
are watching something else, like academic lecture material.</p>
<p>This raises a very important question - is the system behaving in an ethical manner? Is it ethical
to show cat videos to a person trying to study and nudge them towards wasting their time? Even that
is a fairly benign example. There are far worse examples mentioned in the TED talk above.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is the value function. Our systems are often blisfully unaware of any side
effects their decision may cause and blatantly disregard basic rules of behaviour that we take for
granted. They have no other values than the value they&#39;re maximizing. For them, the end justifies
the means. If the value function is maximized by manipulating people, preying on their insecurities,
making them scared, angry or sad - all of that is unimportant. If they find that the most effective
way to keep a person on the same page is to show them something that will render them unconscious,
they would happily do that.</p>
<p>So how do we make these systems ethical?</p>
<p>The first challenge is technical, and its the easiest one. How do we come up with a value function
that encodes additional basic values of of human ethics? Its easy as pie! You take a bunch of
ethicists, give them various situations and ask them to rate actions as ethical/unethical. Then once
you have enough data, you train the value function so that the system can learn some basic humanity.
All done. (If only things were that easy!)</p>
<p>The second challenge is a business one. How far are you willing to reduce your value maximisation
to be ethical? What to do if your competitor doesn&#39;t do that? What are the ethics of putting a
number on how much ethics you&#39;re willing to sacrifice for profits? (Spoiler alert: they&#39;re not
great)</p>
<p>One way to solve that is to have regulations for ethical behaviour of machine learning systems.
Such systems could be held responsible for unethical actions. If those actions are reported by
people, investigated by experts and found true in court, the company owning the ML system is held
liable. Unethical behaviour of machine learning systems shouldn&#39;t be <em>too</em> difficult to spot,
although getting evidence might prove difficult. Public pressure and exposure of companies seems
to help too. Perhaps we could make a machine learning systems that detects unethical behaviour and
call it the ML police. Citizens could agree to install the ML police add-on to help monitor
and aggregate behaviour of online ML systems. (If these suggestions look silly, its because they
are)</p>
<p>The third challenge is philosophical. Until now, philosophers were content with &quot;there is no right
answer, but there have been many thoughts on what exactly is ethical&quot;. They better get their act
together, because we&#39;ll need them to come up with a definite, quantifiable answer real soon.</p>
<p>On the more optimistic side, I hope that any generally agreed upon &quot;standard&quot; ethical system will
be better than none.</p>
