<p>They will often say, &quot;of course we need this or that feature, that's common sense - everyone else has that&quot;. Well, that's actually a problem - or at least, it should raise a small alarm.</p>
<p>The problem with common sense is precisely that its common. You are one person, or perhaps a small team, working on something big. There are other companies on the market. Most of them are larger than you, some to a scary degree (e.g. Google, Microsoft). Many of them are already well established into the market.</p>
<p>Do you think they're not working on common sense things? Do you believe you are so good that you can defeat them at that game?</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn't presume to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Sure, your smaller size means less overhead. You can move faster. You are not constrained by existing established company structures. The problem is, other companies don't need to move fast to cover common-sense things. They likely already have a plan and a strategy in place to deal with those, precisely because they are common sense.</p>
<p>The key to a successful startup is finding a decent chunk of uncommon sense (or smaller scattered bits and pieces of it), then building around it. You have to ask yourself - what are the things other companies are not seeing? What are the things they are not likely to see until its too late?</p>
<p>Its actually not that difficult to find uncommon sense. It exists in all kinds and all sizes. Take Word's track changes feature for example. Everyone takes it for granted that that's the way you have to do legal drafting. But if you actually using it to get any sense of how a document has developed over the course of weeks or months, it suddenly doesn't work. If you forget to turn it on, your changes are untracked. Typing is awkward and if you make one wrong move the way the changes are expressed looks wrong. There are all sorts of annoying things about existing established practices, and a startup has an opportunity to rethink how they work and to see if there are other tools or techniques</p>
<p>This is not without its pitfalls. You can't assume that any half-informed idea that you come up with is going to work. You'll have to do user research and product work to make it into something that can be used. But once you do a few of these, especially small ones, your product will start to somehow &quot;feel&quot; better.</p>
<p>In some cases, your competitors won't really have an idea why your product feels better. Because the pains you've addressed are not common sense, it won't be so easy to tell what exactly about your product compels other users to use it. After all, both products check the same checkboxes, and their product checks even more checkboxes, so there is no reason why it should be worse. Users will likely describe the benefits with vague terms such as as &quot;the whole experience feels better&quot;.</p>
<p>In other cases, competitors will know whats going on and attempt to copy your idea. Some of them might succeed, but the overwhelming likelihood is that they won't fully see the smaller bits of uncommon sense that you thought through. And by that time, an inferior copy from another company will find it harder to compete, even if that company is relatively big and well established</p>
<p>And yes, you will get things wrong sometimes as well. Its not always easy to tell uncommon sense from nonsense. But in the case of startups, the mind shift is necessary and the risk is worth the reward. The alternative is to neither succeed, nor fail.</p>
